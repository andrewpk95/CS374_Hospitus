## 5. Studio Feedback

### Feedbacks to be addressed: 

Narrow down the target user -> Narrowed down the target users to patients with physical injuries.

Too much texts, avoid blocks of texts -> Next time, use keywords and pictograms. Divide information into several slides.

Medical terms needed explanation -> Add caption to explain terms that are difficult and also write it in Korean for Korean students.

Needs need to be prioritized -> Identifying which information is crucial and align them in order.


### Constructive Feedbacks: 

Categorization of interview questions -> Keep categorizing information according to right criterions.

Deep storytelling -> Give deep storytelling so the listeners are more engaged.

Using bold for important terminology -> Point out important keywords.
