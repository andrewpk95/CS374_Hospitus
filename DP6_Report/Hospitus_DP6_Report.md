## 1. POV, Target Users, Tasks

### POV

A foreigner who suffers from sports injury [user] needs to find a good hospital with ample accommodation space quickly [needs] because without information, he or she may waste a lot of time jumping between hospitals [insights]. 

### Target Users

A foreigner seeking treatment and accommodation who doesn’t know Korean.

### Tasks

1. Provides the most suitable hospital for the user
2. User can see the nearby conveniences of the hospital he/she plans to visit
3. User can provide information on the hospital he/she stayed for the next users

Our tasks are related to our target user because...

1. Foreigners unlike locals, don’t have a lot of friends or acquaintances in Korea to suggest hospitals to use. It is difficult for them to find the hospitals that suits them and having a validation system created by other fellow foreigners can help them find a hospital.
2. Since the foreigners are experiencing language barriers, they have a hard time contacting the hospitals ahead and asking them about the information of the hospital, or finding them online. Hospitus can provide that information fast and easy so that the foreigners know what they are getting into.
3. Foreigners often have hard time searching for conveniences. We provide all the information about that so that our users can have access to whatever they might need.
4. Users can express how they felt about the hospitals they have been to, and help other potential users
