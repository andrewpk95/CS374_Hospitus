*How does the Top 3 questions relate to our target users?*
- Physically injured patients generally are asked to be hospitalized for a long period of time. Therefore the information about the accommodation would be much more important than other general patients.
- Physically injured patients are in an urgent situation and in a lot of pain. Minimizing the time that is required to get the treatment is much more important than the general patients. Also, not being able to get treatment in time for physically injured patients could result in lifelong side effects. Therefore, the time required to find the appropriate hospital and the availability of the hospitals is crucial to patients who have acquired physical injuries.
