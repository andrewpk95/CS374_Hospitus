## 3. Briefing

Hospitus helps foreigners find the hospital they need. With Hospitus you can select your injury. For example, you can select “cuts and puncture wounds”. Hospitus will come up with a list of hospitals you can get further information. On the search result page, you will be able to see summarized important information of each hospital. If you click the hospital name, you will be able to view reviews that other foreigners wrote about the hospital in English. 


## 4. Tasks

1. Find the hospital with the best rating on service
2. Find the hospital that has the equipments and treatments required
3. Find the hospital that has enough accommodation

Our tasks are related to our target user because...

- Foreigners unlike locals, don’t have a lot of friends or acquaintances in Korea to suggest hospitals to use. It is difficult for them to find the hospitals that suits them and having a validation system created by other fellow foreigners can help them find a hospital.
- Since the foreigners are experiencing language barriers, they have a hard time contacting the hospitals ahead and asking them about the information of the hospital, or finding them online. Hospitus can provide that information fast and easy so that the foreigners know what they are getting into.


## 5. Observations

### Task 1: Find the hospital with the best rating on service
* [Critical: HIGH] There is no option to sort by the service rating in the search results page (right now it only has sort option by overall rating). (P1, P2, P3)
  * Solution: Add the options to sort search results by Service, Food, Hygiene, and Location ratings. 
* [Critical: Medium] The patient has a hard time locating where the information of service rating is in the review page. (P2, P3)
  * Solution: Make ratings stand out more than other elements in the review page. 
* [Critical: Low] The patient does not see the actual numbers for service rating. (P1)
  * Solution: Display numbers for other ratings as well. 
* [Critical: Low] The patient does not understand that the biggest font rating is the overall rating. (P2)
  * Solution: Change the label to “Overall Rating” to clarify. 
### Task 2: Find the hospital that has the equipments and treatments required
* [Critical: HIGH] The patient does not know which equipment he actually needs to look for when he or she chooses a certain injury. (P1, P2, P3) 
  * Solution: Tell the user in the search page that search results are displayed by the equipment that the patient needs (ex. User selects “Broken Bone” for the injury, search page tells the user that it searched for hospitals that has the “X-Ray” equipment). 
* [Critical: Medium] The drop down view might not have the injury the patient has. (P1)
  * Solution: Change the drop down menu into text input field, and include as many kinds of injuries as possible. 
* [Critical: Low] With the drop down view system for the injury, it is difficult to locate and choose the injury the patient is looking for. (P1)
  * Solution: Change the drop down menu into text input field and make it into autocomplete. 
### Task 3: Find the hospital that has enough accommodation
* [Critical: Medium] The patient could not find out how to sort the search results by availability (hidden by the drop-down menu) (P3)
  * Solution: Instead of drop down menu for the Sort By, lay out sorting options into radio buttons. 
* [Critical: Low] The patient wants to know what type of rooms are available, such as single rooms and double rooms. (P2)
  * Solution: Provide such additional information in the review page. 
### Miscellaneous
* [Critical: HIGH] There is no go-back button in the review page. (P1, P2, P3)
  * Solution: Create go-back buttons for the review pages.


## 6. Individual Reflections

### 20130736 Andrew Kim (Role: Computer)

I played the role of a ‘computer’ throughout the testing process, doing the paper prototype for the participants. I processed the user’s inputs (clicking on the paper prototype) and layed out outputs (hospital search results, review page…) for the users. One difficulty I faced playing the role was remembering all possibility of actions the participants might take and processing it. Another difficulty I faced was rummaging through the paper finding the right review page for the user. Even though I practiced with the paper prototype beforehand, every new session made me nervous which did not let me focus in performing well as a computer role. As a ‘computer’ role, I learned how hard it is for humans to act as a computer, and learned to appreciate the computers doing the processing for us. 

### 20130760 Junho Son (Role: Facilitator)

I was the facilitator of our group. There was not much explanation to do for the tester because the briefing was pretty much enough to explain the function of the prototype. One thing I had to do was to explain what could be clicked for further interactions and what couldn’t be. Overall the job was not very difficult.
